0.09_18 Released at 2007-05-16.
        Added ttpcks (rxpcks + txpcks) to NetStats.
        Fixed a bug in DiskStats. The field for wrtbyt was wrong.
        Changed method name fproc() to psfind().
0.09_17 Released at 2007-04.27.
        Fixed actime from Processes.pm.
        Null values are now printed as 0.00 by ProcStats, NetStats,
          DiskStats and PgSwStats.
0.09_16 Released at 2007-04-21.
        Fixed code in NetStats.pm, DiskStats.pm, PgSwStats.pm and
          ProcStats.pm. It seems to run better and better. :-)
0.09_15 Error by uploading to pause.
0.09_14 Released at 2007-04-13.
        Code fixes.
0.09_13 Released at 2007-04-13.
        Did some fixes in DiskStats.pm, because the error message
          "... no diskstats found ..." is ever issued.
        Did some fixes in fproc() and search() of Linux.pm.
0.09_12 Released at 2007-04-12.
        Changed search() and fproc(). Now statistics can be set
          as second argument. The first argument have to be the
          search filter. Both arguments have to be a hash refrence.
0.09_11 Released at 2007-04-12.
        To much files uploaded. :-)
0.09_10 Released at 2007-04-12.
        Fixed the "Can't call method _struct" bug in Linux.pm line 419.
        "new" from ProcStats is float now. Did some fixes in ProcStats,
          NetStats, PgSwStats and DiskStats... wrong averages/s calculated.
0.09_09 Released at 2007-04-12.
        Delete key "pid" from Processes() because it exists double
          times: $stats->{Processes}->{$pid}->{pid} = $pid
        Now all values of PgSwStats, NetStats, DiskStats and ProcStats
          (here only the key "new") are values per second. I break
          this down because it's very confusing if the statistics are
          just add together. Now there are all rxbyt/s or pgpgin/s or new/s.
        I kicked IO::File and the _load() Method from some modules
          because they wasn't really necessary.
0.09_08 Released at 2007-03-05.
        Add the method fproc() to search for processes.
        Add t/14fproc.t and changed other test file names.
        Improve the search() method and add a bit documentation.
0.09_06 Released at 2007-02-25.
        Improve the search() method. Now it's possible to search()
          for special devices and more.
0.09_05 Released at 2007-02-23.
        Added realfreeper to MemStats.
0.09_04 Released at 2007-02-23.
        The next release today. :)
        Added key realfree to MemStats (free + buffers + cached).
0.09_03 Released at 2007-02-23.
        Added key ttime to Processes (stime + utime).
        Fixed NetStats.t and Processes.t - missed ttbyt and ttime.
0.09_02 Released at 2007-02-23.
        Fixed search(). Now it returns only that statistics that
          matched the search string.
0.09_01 Released at 2007-02-19.
        A lot of changes in Linux.pm.
        Sub modules will only be loaded if they are needed now.
        Added a search() method to search for values in statistics.
        Now there are different options (-1, 0, 1, 2) available
          for the statistics.
        Added key ttbyt to NetStats (total bytes rx + tx).
0.08    Released at 2007-02-13.
        Added key writeback to MemStats and actualize the
          documentation. The new keys dirty, slab, mapped
          and writeback are only available by kernels from
          2.6.
0.07    Released at 2007-02-12.
        Added keys dirty, slab and mapped to MemStats.
0.06    Released at 2007-01-22.
        Bugfix in ProcStats.pm. "count" statistics fixed.
        Added t/Pod-Coverage.t.
0.05    Released at 2006-12-30.
        Updated t/DiskStats.t.
        Updated POD and README.
0.04    Released at 2006-12-29.
        DiskStats died now if the read access to /proc/partitions
          was successful and if there are no statistics. The reason
          is that it seems to be that the linux kernel (<=2.4) is not
          compiled with CONFIG_BLK_STATS=y. Up to now the message
          "there are no initial statistics defined" was generated
          and this message is not very helpful if init() was called.
0.03    Released at 2006-12-28.
        Updated Sys::Statistics::Linux::CpuStats. There wasn't
          irq and softirq calculated for the uptime for each cpu.
          This values are only available with kernels > 2.4.
          That aren't new keys! Just added for calculation.
          Thanks to Alexey A Makeev for his report!
          In addition I updated the documentation for iowait and
          note that this statistic is only available by kernel
          versions higher than 2.4.
        All values for CpuStats are now ever floats "%.2f", not only
          if the values are higher than 0.
0.02    Released at 2006-12-09.
        No code changes. Just updated POD and added t/Pod.t.
0.01	Released at 2006-12-08.
x.xx	Thanks to Larry Wall and all other Perl developer for Perl :-)
