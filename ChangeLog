          matched the search string.
0.09_01 Released at 2007-02-19.
        A lot of changes in Linux.pm.
        Sub modules will only be loaded if they are needed now.
        Added a search() method to search for values in statistics.
        Now there are different options (-1, 0, 1, 2) available
          for the statistics.
        Added key ttbyt to NetStats (total bytes rx + tx).
0.08    Released at 2007-02-13.
        Added key writeback to MemStats and actualize the
          documentation. The new keys dirty, slab, mapped
          and writeback are only available by kernels from
          2.6.
0.07    Released at 2007-02-12.
        Added keys dirty, slab and mapped to MemStats.

        Bugfix in ProcStats.pm. "count" statistics fixed.

0.05    Released at 2006-12-30.
        Updated t/DiskStats.t.
        Updated POD and README.
0.04    Released at 2006-12-29.
        DiskStats died now if the read access to /proc/partitions
          was successful and if there are no statistics. The reason
          is that it seems to be that the linux kernel (<=2.4) is not
          compiled with CONFIG_BLK_STATS=y. Up to now the message
          "there are no initial statistics defined" was generated
          and this message is not very helpful if init() was called.
0.03    Released at 2006-12-28.
        Updated Sys::Statistics::Linux::CpuStats. There wasn't
          irq and softirq calculated for the uptime for each cpu.
          This values are only available with kernels > 2.4.
          That aren't new keys! Just added for calculation.
          Thanks to Alexey A Makeev for his report!
          In addition I updated the documentation for iowait and
          note that this statistic is only available by kernel
          versions higher than 2.4.
        All values for CpuStats are now ever floats "%.2f", not only
          if the values are higher than 0.
0.02    Released at 2006-12-09.
        No code changes. Just updated POD and added t/Pod.t.
0.01	Released at 2006-12-08.
x.xx	Thanks to Larry Wall and all other Perl developer for Perl :-)
