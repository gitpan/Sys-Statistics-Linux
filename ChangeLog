0.03    Released at 2006-12-28.
        Updated Sys::Statistics::Linux::CpuStats. There wasn't
          irq and softirq calculated for the uptime for each cpu.
          This values are only available with kernels > 2.4.
          That aren't new keys! Just added for calculation.
          Thanks to Alexey A Makeev for his report!
          In addition I updated the documentation for iowait and
          note that this statistic is only available by kernel
          versions higher than 2.4.
        All values for CpuStats are now ever floats "%.2f", not only
          if the values are higher than 0.
